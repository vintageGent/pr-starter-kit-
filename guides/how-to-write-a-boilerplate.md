# How to Write a Boilerplate

## What is a Boilerplate?

A "boilerplate" is the short, standardized paragraph about your company that appears at the very end of a press release, right before the media contact information. Its name comes from the old days of printing, where this block of text was cast on a metal plate (a "boilerplate") to be used over and over again.

The purpose of the boilerplate is to provide journalists with essential, at-a-glance information about your organization. It should be consistent across all your press releases.

## What to Include (The 4 Key Ingredients)

A good boilerplate is concise and informative. It should answer these questions in 3-5 sentences:

1.  **Who you are:** Start with your official company name and what your company *is*.
    *   *Example:* "Innovate Inc. is a leading provider of cloud-based project management software..."

2.  **What you do:** Briefly describe your main products, services, or what you help your customers achieve.
    *   *Example:* "...designed for creative agencies and marketing teams."

3.  **Who you serve (Your Audience/Market):** Mention your target audience or the industry you operate in.
    *   *Example:* "Serving over 10,000 customers worldwide..."

4.  **Your Mission or Vision (Optional but good):** Add your company's mission, purpose, or a key achievement. This adds personality.
    *   *Example:* "The company's mission is to make collaboration seamless and beautiful."

## Tips for Writing a Great Boilerplate

*   **Keep it short:** Aim for 50-100 words.
*   **Be factual, not fluffy:** Avoid marketing jargon like "world-class," "synergy," or "disruptive." Stick to what your company does.
*   **Write it once, use it everywhere:** Keep it consistent across your website, press releases, and other official documents.
*   **Include your website:** Always end with a link to your website.
